Although intranasal steroids and anti-cysteinyl-leukotriene-receptor antagonists are efficacious in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR), combinations of these agents have not unequivocally been demonstrated to be superior to the individual drugs. We aimed to compare the efficacy and potential mechanisms of budesonide nasal spray (BD), oral montelukast (MNT), and combination therapy comprising a half-dose of budesonide plus montelukast (hBD+MNT) in SAR patients.
